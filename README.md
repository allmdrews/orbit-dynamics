# orbit-dynamics
For different initial state vectors (containting 3 position and 3 velocity values), two methods on how to get the orbits are demonstrated. There are static and animated visualisations shown. 

To observe interesting behaviour, change the initial state vectors. To test the limits of the integrating functions of Python, change for example the time steps.
